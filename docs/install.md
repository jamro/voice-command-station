## Assembly

### 3D Printed Case

The case for Yova consists of 2 main elements that need to be 3D printed:
- `yova_case_top.stl` - Top cover of the case
- `yova_case_bottom.stl` - Bottom base of the case

**Important:** Print in PETG or ABS material to ensure the case can withstand the heat generated by the Raspberry Pi without damage.

All 3D models are provided in the `3d_models` folder. The folder also contains:
- `yova.skp` - SketchUp project file for case customization if needed
- `yova.png` - Preview of the assembled device

### Assembly Steps

1. **Prepare Components:**
   - 3D printed case parts (top and bottom)
   - Raspberry Pi 5
   - ReSpeaker 2-Mic HAT
   - Mini Speaker
   - 7x 2mm screws for assembly

2. **Install ReSpeaker HAT:**
   - Place the ReSpeaker 2-Mic HAT on top of the Raspberry Pi
   - Ensure proper alignment with the GPIO pins

3. **Connect Speaker:**
   - Connect the mini speaker to the audio output
   - You may need to replace the default speaker's connector with a JST PH2.00
   - Place the speaker into the top case, mounting hole.

4. **Assemble Case:**
   - Place the Raspberry Pi with HAT into the bottom case
   - Secure the Raspberry Pi with the 4x 2mm screws to the bottom case
   - Align the top case with the bottom case
   - Secure both parts together using the remaining 3x 2mm screws

5. **Power Connections:**
   - **Raspberry Pi Power:** Connect the main power supply to the Raspberry Pi's USB-C port
   - **ReSpeaker HAT Power:** Connect a separate USB power source to the ReSpeaker HAT's USB port
   - **Important:** The ReSpeaker HAT must be powered separately to provide adequate power for the speaker and prevent damage to the audio components. Without HAT power, audio will be distorted and may damage the speaker, HAT, or Raspberry Pi.

6. **Final Check:**
   - Ensure all connections are secure
   - Verify the case is properly closed
   - Check that all ports remain accessible
   - Check if the push-to-talk button is working (there should be a click sound when pressed)

## Raspberry Pi Configuration

### System Requirements
